    <p>In HTML there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. <b>Block Level</b> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while <b> inline level</b> elements typically appear within the flow of text content. </p>
    <p>In this example the <b>heading 1</b> and the <b>paragraphs</b> are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
    <p> In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models: <b>Flow, Metadata,Embedded,Interactive,Heading, and Sectioning.</b> To learn more about them, visit the <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/">interactive graphics</a> contained in W3 HTML5 specification.</p>
