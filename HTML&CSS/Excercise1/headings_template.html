    <h2>Formatting Page Content</h2>
    <p>In this series of excercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.</p>
    <h3>Adding Headings</h3>
    <p>Headings help define the structure of the page and control the heirarchy of the content. You can use heading values ranging from a top-level heading of h1 all the way down to h6. While there are several competing theories on the exact startegy to use when choosing headings, what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent manner, to accurateky reflect the importance of yur content. I'ts also important to be consistent in how you use headings across your site, so deciding when and how to use headings is an important part of planning your site.</p>
    <h3>Using Paragraphs</h3>
    <p> The paragraph tag((p)) is one of the most basic formatting tags, and one that you'll use often. It indicates a paragraph of text and should be used for each individual paragraph.</p>
    <h3>Line Breaks</h3>
    <p>Occassionally you'll need to perform a "soft return", that is, create a new line without using a new paragraph. To do that in HTML, yu use the line break tag((br)). Line break tags are inline , meaning you cn use them within headers and paragraphs, and dont require a closing tag. Let's say you were formatting an address, for example. You could use line breaks to make each line of the adddress appeared on a seperate line, but all remained within the same paragraph lynda.com 6410 Via Real Carpinteria, CA 93103.</p>
